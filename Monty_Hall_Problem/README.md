# Monty Hall problem
The Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in which there are three doors
2 doors have gotten a goat behind them, and 1 has gotten a car behind it.
When you choose a door there is a 33% change of guessing the correct door
When you choose Monty opens a door with a goat behind it, You can now choose to switch or stay
switching leaves you with a 50% change of guessing the correct door but staying leaves you with the 33% change you had before,
So goes the famous problem.

Example:

| output |
|  :-:   |
|   STAYING 333577   |
|   SWITCHING 666423   |

It's very interesting to see that switching leaves you with a much higher change of winning
