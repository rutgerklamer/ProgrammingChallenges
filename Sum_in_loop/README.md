# Sum in loop

Now our goal is to learn the loops - i.e. repeated actions. 
Let us find the sum of several numbers (more than two).
It will be useful to do this in a loop. 
As shown in the picture above - you can create variable sum and add every value from the list to it.
Perhaps "for" loop will suit nicely since the amount of numbers is known beforehand.
