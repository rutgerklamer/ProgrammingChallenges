# Programming Challenges
This page is for small little programming challenges I think don't deserve a seperate github page so I've made this repository to store them in one collection.

I've mainly used rosetta code for the challenges but I didn't always follow the specifications since I thought they were stupid or unnecessary.

Here is a list given in the order in which I made them
- [99 Bottles of Beer](https://github.com/rutgerklamer/ProgrammingChallenges/tree/master/99_Bottles_of_Beer)
