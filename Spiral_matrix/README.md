# Spiral matrix

Starting with 1 in the center of the grid we spiral outwards to the top-right corner of the grid.

example:
| input | output| 
|  :-:  |  :-:  |
| 5 | ```
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13
``` |

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
