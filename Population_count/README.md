# Population Count
This challenge I needed to check the population count of a number,
1 is a person and 0 is nothing, If we translate 5 to binary we get 101, so the population for the number 5 is 2
I also needed to check for evil and odious numbers, 
An evil number has en even population and an odious has a odd population.

example:

| input   |  evil  | odius        |  poulation |
| :-: | :-: | :-:      | :-:      |
| 5   |  *true*  | *false*        | 2 |
| 3   |  *true*  | *false*        |  2 |
| 59   |  *false* |  *true* | 5 |
